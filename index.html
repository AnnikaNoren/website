	    Leverage innovative study and test taking strategies proven to be successful. The initial session of our innovative program took place last summer with incredible results. Our 6 students achieved an average SAT score improvement of 290 points (industry average for tutoring is a 90 point increase) and 4 points on the ACT, we had one student earn a perfect 2400, and 5 students earned over 2100. Please see our results page for details.

At the end of each week there is a prize drawing. The more points you earn during the week, the greater your chances of winning. You will be part of a team of students that challenges and supports you. We know the more fun it is to study, the more you will study, and the better you will do on the exams.

	  <p class="text-left" style="padding-bottom: 15px;font-size: 16px">
	    At inspireDo we know the key to success is regular, focused practice in reasonable amounts. An average of one hour per day is all we ask our students to commit to studying.  All of the studying takes place during the summer so you won't be burdened by school course load. A unique weekly schedule is created for each student taking into account their other commitments. Periodic breaks are important, so every week there is a study-free day scheduled and each student is allocated a one week vacation during the program.

	  <p class="text-left" style="padding-bottom: 15px;font-size: 16px;">
	    We know how hard it is to be admitted to the college of your choice. The scores you achieve on your SAT / ACT can have a large bearing on whether you are accepted at your favorite schools. A recent study by the National Association For College Admission Counseling found "a small increase in test score could have a significant impact on an applicant’s chances of being admitted." Furthermore, the Wall Street Journal has found that your scores can have an impact well after college because employers are now using SAT scores as an employment qualification tool. We inspire you to put forth the effort and coach you to master the content, skills and strategies to be admitted to the college of your choice.

	  <h4 style="font-weight: bold">Schedule</h4>
	  <p class="text-left" style="padding-bottom: 15px;font-size: 16px">
	    The program runs for nine weeks (July 5th - September 2nd). The typical summer weekly schedule consists of: up to 2 personalized tutoring sessions (up to 30 minutes each); 5 practice sessions (1 hour each); and daily brain training (10 minutes). You will take the official ACT exam on Sept. 3rd and the first official SAT exam of the fall (likely October 8th).
